**NOTE: THESE HAVE NOT BEEN TESTED. USE WITH CAUTION**

These kicad project files are automagically generated from the
original Altium files using:
  https://github.com/thesourcerer8/altium2kicad/

They are provided for people who want to make their own board
variants, and thus it is up to the person making a derivative
to verify the board for correctness as these have never been
tested.

The PCB file looks correct.

The SCH file has the major components (surprisingly) but the
power port labels are broken. PR's to fix this by kicad users would
be highly appreciated

Consistent with Sparky2, these files are license CC-BY-SA-NC 4.0
